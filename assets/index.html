          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is John Ray, also known by my handle PurpXPanda, and I'm a full-stack web developer who is just starting out on my coding journey. I'm passionate about using my skills and expertise to create innovative solutions that drive results for businesses and individuals.</p>
          <p>Throughout my bootcamp, I've had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, from my JavaScript Quiz to the shared-lunch web app I designed with a team from my bootcamp. I take pride in delivering high-quality work that meets and exceeds my clients' expectations. I'm constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a professional.</p>
          <p>When I'm not working, you can find me playing video games, cooking, and spending time with my family. I believe that maintaining a healthy work-life balance is essential for staying energized and creative.</p>
